# Project-4-phrase-hunter-game
 Techdegree project 4

The target is to create word guessing game "Phrase Hunter".

The phrase, in my case movie title, is shown on the screen with its letters hidden. Player has 5 lives to open all letters and win the game.

The focus of the project was to practice not only JavaScript but Object-Oriented Programming.

Some style personalisation includes showing right letters in green and wrong letters in red, hidden letters in light yellow, as well as animated change of colors in the win message.
